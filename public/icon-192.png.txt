This is a placeholder. In production, replace with actual PNG icons:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can create these icons using:
1. Online tools: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Or design software like Figma, Canva, etc.

For now, the app will work but may show default browser icon.
